The CDR Plus (CDR+) project is a set extension specifications for the Australian Consumer Data Right.

CDR+ seeks to introduce enhancements and new features, in a backward compatible way, for Data Holder and Data Recipient implementations.

## About

The CDR+ initiative is a community project to introduce enhancements and new features into the emerging Consumer Data Right ecosystem.

While the [Data Standards Body](https://consumerdatastandards.gov.au/) develops the binding [Standards](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards for the [Consumer Data Right](https://cdr.gov.au) it is, by virtue of being a legislatively binding technical implementation, relatively slow moving and constrained by what all participants (particularly the Big 4 banks) are able to achieve within their individual technical environments.

CDR+ aims to provide an incubator for feature enhancements beyond the mandated obligations and to ultimately provide a feeder into the binding Data Standards.
