# DataRight+
{: .fs-9 }
An initiative to extend and expand the Consumer Data Right beyond the mandate and into the world
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The DataRight Plus (DataRight+) initiative is a community project to build upon and extend the technical specifications first created in the production of the [Consumer Data Right].

DataRight+ aims to provide an incubator for feature enhancements beyond the mandated obligations present with the [Consumer Data Right] while looking beyond Australia and into a global context.

_We are:_

- Implementor first
- Seeking to improve the [Consumer Data Right]
- Global promoters of the technical specifications

_We aren't:_

- **Endorsed by any** government body, although we collaborate with members of government all the same
- Legally binding **in any way**
- A CDR Support service, please use the [CDR Zendesk]
