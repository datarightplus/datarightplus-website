# DataRight+
{: .fs-9 }
An initiative to extend and expand the Consumer Data Right beyond the mandate and into the world
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The DataRight Plus (DataRight+) initiative is a community project to build upon and extend the technical specifications first created in the production of the [Consumer Data Right].

DataRight+ aims to provide an incubator for feature enhancements beyond the mandated obligations present with the [Consumer Data Right] while looking beyond Australia and into a global context.

- **We are** implementor **first**
- **We are** seeking to improve the [Consumer Data Right] but, more broadly, provide global input into common challenges faced by open data ecosystems
- **We are** global promoters of the technical specifications
- **We aren't** endorsed by any government body, although we collaborate with members of government all the same
- **We aren't** legally binding **in any way**
- **We aren't** a CDR Support service, please use the [CDR Zendesk]

## Library

The DataRight+ initiative develops, manages and maintains multiple sets of specifications across a variety of knowledge specialisations. In addition, we manage and maintain a set of API documentation that is referenced from within these RFC compliant specifications. We collectively refer to this as a Library of specifications with the deliberate intent of enabling others to select specific components they wish to use when building ecosystems.

We do not believe the best interests of an implementor is served through a set of unrelated concepts being merged together into a sea of text but rather individual concepts, carefully specified and reasonably grouped to allow subject-matter experts in specific delivery areas focus on their specific outcomes.
