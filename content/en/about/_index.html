The CDR+ initiative is a community project to introduce enhancements and new features into the emerging Consumer Data Right ecosystem.

While the <a href="https://consumerdatastandards.gov.au/">Data Standards Body</a> develops the binding <a href="https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards">Standards</a> for the <a href="https://cdr.gov.au">Consumer Data Right</a> it is, by virtue of being a legislatively binding technical implementation, relatively slow moving and constrained by what all participants (particularly the Big 4 banks) are able to achieve within their individual technical environments.

CDR+ aims to provide an incubator for feature enhancements beyond the mandated obligations and to ultimately provide a feeder into the binding Data Standards.
