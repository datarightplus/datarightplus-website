description: The Parity specifications group focuses on delivering international standards format specifications for the underlying Data Standards. The primary motivation for this is that as specification development progressed beyond the existing Data Standard there was a realisation that effectively back referencing to the Data Standards posed significant challenges. Over time we hope the DSB adopts an internationally aligned format so that we can more effectively avoid duplication.

## CDR+ Infosec: Baseline Profile

The CDR+ Infosec: Baseline Profile is intended to be a like-for-like profile of the Data Standards presented as a profile of _[Financial-grade API Security Profile 1.0 Part 2: Advanced](https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-part-2-1_0.html)_. This profile focuses primarily on the obligations between OP and RP with respect to authorisation requests and does so as an overlay on the underlying FAPI profile. It does not attempt to provide elaboration on registration protocols, certificate profiles, federation or other components specified within the _[Data Standards: Security Profile](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards/#security-profile)_.
